# Rician-Fading-Python

The Rician fading model implemented in python.

It uses PySimpleGUI, numpy, matplotlib and tkinter.

This was developed on a windows OS, using Spyder IDE with Python 3.8. All the dependencies where installed by anaconda.

Runing main.py to start the GUI displays:

Entering values for the Rician K factor, the root mean sqaure of the signal (\hat{r}^2), and \phi the phase parameter.

The theoretical evenlope PDF and phase PDFs are plotted to compare with the simulation and gives the execution time for the theoretical calculations and simulations together.
